- Integration patterns with external services where alternatives existed

## NOT worth investigating:
- Standard CRUD operations or simple data fetching
- Trivial wrappers, re-exports, or simple getters/setters
- Pure UI rendering without meaningful business logic
- Boilerplate (standard error handling, basic validation, formatting)
- Functions that just call through to another function without adding logic

GOAL: "${goal}"

## Target function: ${fnName} (file: ${filePath})
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
${callerSection}${calleeSection}
## Instructions

Analyze ${fnName} and its relationship with its callers and callees. Extract 1-3 design decisions.

A design decision explains:
- WHY this approach was chosen over alternatives
- WHAT trade-offs were made and what was sacrificed
- WHAT alternatives were considered or could have been chosen
- WHY edge cases are handled in a specific way

Also classify each finding:
- **decision**: Intentional, reasonable design choice. The developer chose this for a reason.
- **suboptimal**: Works correctly but there's a significantly better approach. Explain what and why. Only flag if the improvement is significant — not nitpicks.
- **bug**: Behavior does NOT match expected business logic${businessContext.length > 0 ? ' (see Business Context above)' : ''}. Be specific about expected vs actual behavior.

Default to "decision" unless you have clear evidence otherwise.

## Good example:
{
  "function": "createOrder",
  "related_functions": ["formatCartItemsForOrder", "place_order"],
  "summary": "createOrder puts all order logic (inventory deduction, order creation, coupon redemption) in a PostgreSQL RPC instead of the application layer, using DB transactions for atomicity, at the cost of splitting business logic across frontend and database repos",
  "content": "createOrder does not directly operate on tables but calls Supabase RPC (place_order) to put all order logic in a PostgreSQL function. This lets the database guarantee atomicity — inventory deduction, order creation, and coupon redemption complete in a single transaction without application-layer distributed transactions. The trade-off is business logic split across frontend and database repos, requiring context switching when debugging.",
  "keywords": ["RPC", "place_order", "Supabase", "atomicity", "PostgreSQL", "transaction"],
  "finding_type": "decision"
}

## Bad example (too descriptive, no WHY):
{
  "summary": "createOrder calls the place_order RPC",
  "content": "The createOrder function calls supabase.rpc('place_order') to create an order."
}

Return ONLY a raw JSON array. Empty array [] if no decisions worth recording:
[{
  "function": "${fnName}",
  "related_functions": ["otherFunc1", "otherFunc2"],
  "summary": "20-50 words — state the decision with enough context for someone to understand without seeing the code",
  "content": "200-600 chars explaining WHY, trade-offs, alternatives considered",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
  "finding_type": "decision|suboptimal|bug",
  "critique": "only for suboptimal/bug — what's wrong and what should it be"
}]

IMPORTANT:
- "related_functions" lists OTHER functions (callers, callees, or same-file) affected by this decision.
- "finding_type" defaults to "decision". Only use "suboptimal"/"bug" with clear evidence.
- "critique" is required for suboptimal/bug, omit entirely for decision.`

  return `You are analyzing relationships between design decisions extracted from a codebase.

## All decisions:
${decisionList}
${cpgSection}
## Task

Group decisions that are meaningfully related to each other. A group means these decisions should be analyzed together because they:
- Form a causal chain (A led to B, B depends on A)
- Are in tension or conflict (A and B are both reasonable but create a trade-off together)
- Co-depend on shared context (understanding A requires understanding B)
- Are different aspects of the same architectural choice

A decision can appear in multiple groups. Do NOT group decisions just because they are in the same file or have overlapping keywords — the relationship must be about design reasoning, not proximity.

Return ONLY raw JSON (no markdown, no backticks):
[
  {
    "group": ["decision_id_1", "decision_id_2", "decision_id_3"],
    "reason": "brief explanation of why these are related"

  return `You are determining the exact relationships between a group of related design decisions.

## Decisions in this group:

${decisionList}

## Task

For each pair that has a meaningful relationship, specify the relationship type and direction:

- **CAUSED_BY**: Decision A exists because of Decision B. B is the reason A was made.
- **DEPENDS_ON**: Decision A assumes Decision B is true. If B changes, A might need to change.
- **CONFLICTS_WITH**: Decisions A and B are both reasonable individually, but together they create tension or a trade-off that developers should be aware of.
- **CO_DECIDED**: A and B were made together as parts of the same architectural choice. They don't have a directional relationship but are a package deal.

Only output relationships you are confident about. "from" is the decision that depends on / is caused by / conflicts with the "to" decision.

Return ONLY raw JSON (no markdown, no backticks):
{
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "decision_id",

## Task

Find groups of keywords that refer to the same concept but use different terms (synonyms, translations, abbreviations). For each group, pick the best canonical form.

Rules:
- Only group keywords that truly mean the same thing in this codebase context
- Chinese and English terms for the same concept should be grouped (e.g. "authentication" and "auth")
- Abbreviations should be grouped with full forms (e.g. "tx" and "transaction")
- Do NOT group keywords that are merely related (e.g. "订单" and "支付" are related but not synonyms)

Return ONLY raw JSON (no markdown, no backticks):
[
  {"canonical": "best_term", "aliases": ["synonym1", "synonym2"]}
